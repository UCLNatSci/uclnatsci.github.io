# Getting Started with Cocalc, Jupyter Notebooks and Python

Before you start, you need to create a Cocalc account and add your partner as a collaborator [TODO: Link to instructions]

## Part 1: Editing and Running Notebooks

### Step 1: Log in to Cocalc

> Navigate to www.cocalc.com and sign in using your university email address. Click on project **NSCI0007_20_21** in the project list to load your project.

Your project is essentially a virtual computer hosted in the cloud, and it comes preinstalled with all the software and tools you need to get Python programming straight away!

### Step 2: Open the Week 1 Folder

>Click on the `Handouts` folder then the `01_Introduction` folder.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("hello")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
